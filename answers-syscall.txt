>>> Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
usertrap()

>>> What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent?
p->trapframe->a7 is 7, which represents SYS_exec

>>> What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
User mode as SPP bit of $sstatus is 0.

>>> Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the varialable num?
0x80001ff4 <syscall+20> lw      a3,0(zero) # 0x0
a3

>>> Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above?
Address 0x0 isn't mapped in kernel address space so is inaccessible. scause = 0x000000000000000d represents load page fault.

>>> What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
initcode. pid is 1;
